Preferred Baseline Issues
Point of sale and share data is provided by GPN, based on customer POS entries, and updated on the Preferred RFP Tracker on a weekly basis. The information in the Preferred RFP Tracker is updated weekly and includes POS information through the previous week. In most instances, the baseline information should remain consistent since it is based on historical information, however, there are a number of different factors that can change the baseline share data including but not limited to: changes in office sales/POS system, roster affiliation changes (i.e. adding/removing locations), and timing of when data is refreshed across the various dashboards/tools. 

You may view quarterly RFP history in the Preferred RFP Tracker in the ‘Rebate History’ section.  ACUVUE Share and baseline share will continue to update in the ‘Rebate’ section with the latest data from GPN, based on customer’s POS entries, on a weekly basis. Please continue to reference the most recent updated through dates in the top right of the Preferred RFP Tracker. The ACUVUE® Dashboard Powered by GPN® continues to be updated on a daily basis and can provide up to date information on current effective year to date share. 

While the baseline share value might change throughout a given quarter for the reasons noted above, as outlined in the Preferred agreement, for all POS and share data “calculations will be computed based solely on the data as reflected at the close of the quarter”.

GPN and JJV do not have the ability to alter any POS or share data as it comes in directly from the customer’s practice management system. It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure the data being reported from their POS system is accurate and timely.
Per the    Preferred T&Cs, Section 7 and Section 14(d), the account must have GPN installed at each affiliated location and the account must capture point of sale data at each individual affiliated location. 

Preferred account awaiting validation
GPN data is currently not flowing for this account. If GPN was installed recently, it takes about 3 weeks to complete validation and up to 2 weeks for this to flow to all JnJ systems. 
If GPN has been installed for more than 6 weeks, please use the attached data steps file to assist in resolving the issue.

Partner tier Rebates rules
Accounts in Partner tier are required to grow at least one percentage point of share from the baseline period to earn a rebate. Partner tier accounts that satisfy this growth criteria are eligible for 50% of their YTD RAS growth less their rebate earned previously in the YTD period. 

This account ended 2021 with YTD share of 36.3% qualifying them for Partner tier. Partner tier accounts are required to grow at least one share point to earn a rebate. Their share growth was -3.81%

Current YTD Rev : $13285.36
YTD RAS Growth : $0.00
Preferred rebate: $0.00
Q1 Est. Rebate = $
Q2 Est. Rebate = $2892.36
True-up = 6551.24 - 3450.54- 2892.36 = $208.34.  


GPN Manual Share Finalization and Benefit tier
Final calculations for the Q3 market share and O1D Promotion are based on data provided to us by GPN with data up to and including 10/14/21. Any changes made by the doctor to their data after 10/14/21 will not impact Q3 payments. Please find details of the calculation below:
Q2 Effective YTD share: %
Q1 2021 O1D Share: %
Q2 2021 O1D Share: %
Q2 O1D Share Growth: %
Growth of at least 5% is required for accounts below 80% Effective YTD share to have earned a rebate under this promotion.
Growth of at least 0% is required for accounts at or above 80% Effective YTD share to have earned a rebate under this promotion.

Full Install
There are now two requirements for a group to be considered fully installed:

1.	Total soft_cl >=1 at at least one sap in each quarter in the current YTD period
2.	Total soft_cl >=1 at at least 1 SAP per location in the current quarter

MyApp Account cannot Enroll in Preferred 
I see this account joined MyApp on [insert date] after the [insert Quarter eligibility deadline date]. 
This account is therefore eligible for Rfp in [insert quarter]. 
Once this account shows up in our active rosters for [insert Quarter], you will be able to enroll the account in Preferred.

Rebate Percentage Errors in the Rfp Tracker
This is only a reporting issue in the Rfp tracker and did (does) not affect the rebates earned by these accounts. The team is aware of this and are working to have this resolved. The Q2 percentages have been corrected effective 9/8/21. Please let me know if you have questions.

MyAPP YTD Calc
MyAPP accounts in their 2nd active quarter in the YTD period and a growth of between 5% and 10% require a minimum of $11,000.00 to earn 1% of their YTD rev as rebate, $50,000.00 to earn 3% of their YTD rev as rebate and $100,00.00 to earn 5% of their YTD rev as rebate.
MyAPP accounts in their 2nd active quarter in the YTD period and a growth of between 10% and 15% require a minimum of $11,000.00 to earn 2% of their YTD rev as rebate, $50,000.00 to earn 4% of their YTD rev as rebate and $100,00.00 to earn 6% of their YTD rev as rebate.
MyAPP accounts in their 2nd active quarter in the YTD period and a growth greater than 15% require a minimum of $11,000.00 to earn 3% of their YTD rev as rebate, $50,000.00 to earn 5% of their YTD rev as rebate and $100,00.00 to earn 7% of their YTD rev as rebate.

This account had a YTD rev of $30,082.27 in Q2 less than the $50,000.00 minimum required for a 3% rebate hence the account was eligible for 1% rebate as it had met the minimum of $11,000.00 required.

1%* $46,614.67 = $466.15. 

In Q1, this account earned a rebate of $723.65. 

True up Calculations;
$466.15 - $723.65 = -$ 257.50
Hence why they did not earn a rebate in Q2.

This account had a YTD rev of $ 54682.87 in Q3 less than the $56,250.00 minimum required for a 3% rebate hence the account was eligible for 1% rebate as it had met the minimum of $18,000.00  required.

1%* $54,682.87 = $546.83 
With a previous YTD revenue of $47,748.25 the account grew by $6933.62
Growth rebate: 0.25 * 6933.62 = 1733.41
